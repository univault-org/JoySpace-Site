# Contributing to JoySpace Wiki

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JoySpace Wiki! This guide will walk you through the process of contributing content to our wiki.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (required for forking and creating Pull Requests)
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
- Git installed on your computer

## Contribution Flow

1. Fork the repository (requires GitHub account)
2. Clone your fork
3. Create your content
4. Submit a Pull Request
5. Wait for review and merge

## Detailed Guide

### 1. Fork First, Then Clone

1. **Fork the repository** (required first step):
   - Go to [JoySpace-Site repository](https://github.com/univault-org/JoySpace-Site)
   - Click the 'Fork' button in the top-right corner
   - Wait for GitHub to create your copy of the repository

2. **Clone your fork** (not the original repository):

```bash
#  Clone your fork (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JoySpace-Site.git
cd JoySpace-Site
# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/JoySpace-Site.git

```

### 2. Create Your Content

#### Writing a Blog Post

1. Create a new markdown file in the `content/posts` directory:


# Example structure
content/
└── posts/
    └── my-awesome-post.md  
    └── bookmark-guide.md 
    └── getting-started.md 



2. Add frontmatter with the date (required):


```markdown
---
title: My Awesome Post
date: 2024-03-15
author: Your Name
description: A brief description of your post
tags: ["tutorial", "guide", "tips"]
---
```

> **Important**: Fields containing special characters must be wrapped in quotes `""`. For example:
> - ✅ `title: "My: Awesome Post"`
> - ❌ `title: My: Awesome Post`



#### File Naming Guidelines
- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Keep names short but descriptive
- Don't include dates in filenames
- Use `.md` extension

✅ Good examples:
- `bookmark-guide.md`
- `getting-started.md`
- `quick-tips.md`

❌ Avoid:
- `2024-03-15-my-post.md`
- `My Awesome Post.md`
- `post1.md`

### 3. Preview Your Content

You can easily preview the current content and your additions using the `index.html` file in the root directory:

#### Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1. Install VS Code Live Server extension:
   - Open VS Code Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server"
   - Install "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
   
2. Preview the wiki:
   - Right-click on `index.html` in the root folder
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - Your browser will open with a live preview that updates automatically

#### Option 2: Using Command Line Server

You can run a local server using Python or Node.js:

```bash
# Using Python (Python 3)
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Python (Python 2)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

# Using Node.js (need to install first: npm install -g http-server)
http-server
```

Then open your browser and visit:
- http://localhost:8080 (for Python)
- http://localhost:8080 (for http-server)

> **Note**: Using VS Code Live Server (Option 1) is still the recommended method as it's easier to set up and use.

### 4. Submit Your Contribution

1. Create a branch in your fork:
```bash
git checkout -b post/my-awesome-post
```

2. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add content/posts/my-awesome-post.md
git commit -m "Add: New post about awesome topic"
```

3. Push to your fork:

```bash
git push origin post/my-awesome-post
```


4. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click 'Contribute' > 'Open Pull Request'
   - Select the branch with your changes
   - Fill in the PR template

### 5. Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR
2. They may request changes
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged
4. Site rebuilds automatically with new content

## FAQ

### Q: Can I contribute without a GitHub account?
**A:** No, you need a GitHub account to fork the repository and create Pull Requests. This helps us:
- Track contributions
- Maintain quality
- Provide proper attribution
- Enable collaboration

### Q: Why do I need to fork instead of clone?
**A:** Forking:
- Creates your own copy of the repository
- Allows you to make changes without affecting the original
- Enables proper Pull Request workflow
- Maintains project security

### Q: How do I keep my fork updated?

First, add the upstream repository (only need to do this once):
```bash
# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/univault-org/JoySpace-Site.git
```

Then, whenever you want to update your fork:
```bash
# Fetch changes from upstream repository
git fetch upstream

# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

You can verify your remotes at any time using:
```bash
git remote -v
```
