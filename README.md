# JoySpace Wiki

An open-source platform to organize your bookmarks, screenshots, and media. Bringing joy to your digital organization.

## Our Motivation

Our greatest gift is when something pulls us back to life's essential questions: Why are we here? How do we make sense of our brief human lifespan—mere decades in a universe where light takes millions of years just to travel between galaxies?

This work serves as our gentle reminder of these profound questions. Our hope is that those who benefit from these tools might also receive this gift of awareness. We believe this perspective is the most valuable thing we can offer, far beyond any technical solution.

All our work, in this project and beyond, is simply an opportunity to share this reminder: to pause, to wonder, and to question our place in this vast cosmos.
